# Car Maintenance App

A simple, offline-first mobile app to keep my car maintained without thinking.

## Why
Car maintenance shouldn’t live in my head.
This app turns mileage + time into a predictable system with reminders, receipts, and a clear “what’s next”.

Built for:
- reliability over flash
- correctness over features
- calm UX (reduce anxiety, not add it)

## v1 Scope
- Track odometer mileage
- Generate maintenance schedule by mileage and time
- Show “What’s due next”
- Local reminders (with snooze)
- Service history with photos (receipts)
- Offline-first (no account, no cloud)

## Explicit Non-Goals (v1)
- No cloud sync
- No ads
- No AI features
- No social features
- No dashboards

## Tech (planned)
- React Native (Expo)
- TypeScript
- SQLite (local)
- Local notifications

## Status
🚧 In progress
